# -Andres-Mini-Keyboard-Project
This repository contains my code files and CAD files for my design process for my mini keyboard project. I am designing this project for my APUSH class, I am going to bind the 4 keys to certain sounds from the industrial revolution such as the telegraph, cotton gin, steamboat, and many more! This is my first time designing anything using PCB so I mostly followed the online tutorial, this is also a rush job because I don't know how long it will take to approve and ship the parts so I tried to go as fast as possible so I could use it for my APUSH project!
