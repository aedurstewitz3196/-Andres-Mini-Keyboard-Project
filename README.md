# -Andres-Mini-Keyboard-Project
This repository contains my code files and CAD files for my design process for my mini keyboard project. I am designing this project for my APUSH class, I am going to bind the 4 keys to certain sounds from the industrial revolution such as the telegraph, cotton gin, steamboat, and many more!
